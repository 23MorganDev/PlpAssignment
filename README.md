### Introduction

In this document, I outline the steps I took to set up my developer environment, focusing on Windows 10 Pro, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), Python, Git, MySQL, and various VSCode extensions. This setup is designed to support efficient software development, including coding, debugging, version control, and database management.

### Operating System: Windows 10 Pro

- **Selection Reason**: Chose Windows 10 Pro due to its stability, ease of use, and compatibility with essential development tools.
- **Installation Process**: Followed the standard installation procedure from the Microsoft website, encountering no significant issues.

### Integrated Development Environment: Visual Studio Code

- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Downloaded VSCode from the official website.
  2. Ran the installer and followed the prompts to install.
  3. Customized settings and installed recommended extensions for enhanced productivity.

- **Extensions Installed**:
  - HTML, Htmx Autorename Tags: Simplifies working with HTML and Htmx by automatically renaming tags.
  - Git Lens: Provides rich Git capabilities within VSCode.
  - Wakatime: Tracks coding activity and helps manage time spent on projects.

### Version Control System: Git

- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Downloaded Git from the official website.
  2. Followed the installation wizard, selecting default options.
  3. Configured Git with basic settings (username, email).

- **Initializing a Project with GitHub**:
  1. Created a GitHub account.
  2. Initialized a new repository locally using `git init`.
  3. Linked the local repository to GitHub using `git remote add origin <repository-url>`.

### Programming Language: Python

- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Downloaded Python from the official website.
  2. Selected the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
  3. Verified installation by running `python --version` in Command Prompt.

- **Packages Installed**:
  - Numpy: For numerical computations.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

### Importance of Using Pip in Python

1. **Package Management**: Easily installs and manages Python packages.
2. **Version Control**: Allows specifying versions of packages to avoid conflicts.
3. **Reproducibility**: Ensures that projects can be replicated on different systems.

### Database: MySQL

- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Downloaded MySQL Community Server from the official website.
  2. Followed the installation wizard, accepting default settings.
  3. Completed the security setup, setting a root password.


### Challenges
- **Initial understanding of Git**: Trying to understand Git and understanding how to effectively use VSCode extensions is hard but am continually learning.
- **Path Configuration for MySQL**: I struggled to find the correct path directories and am still trying to find help online on how to fully setup MYSQL in order for it to work correctly.

### Conclusion

This document outlines the steps I took to set up my developer environment, emphasizing the importance of a well-configured workspace for efficient software development. Despite facing some initial challenges, I successfully integrated essential tools and extensions into my workflow, enhancing both productivity and project management capabilities.
